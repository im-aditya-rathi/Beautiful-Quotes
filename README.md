# Beautiful Quotes

A simple web application that suggests random quotes with the author's name. The quotes are fetched from an external API and displayed using a clean and modern design with HTML, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- **Random Quotes:** Display a new random quote each time the page is refreshed or a button is clicked.
- **Author Information:** Each quote includes the author's name.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the page.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the page.
- **API**: Provides the random quotes and author names.

## How It Works

1. The application makes a request to a quotes API to fetch a random quote and the author's name.
2. The received data is then displayed on the page in a user-friendly format.
3. Bootstrap is used to ensure the page looks great on all devices.
